# Text Summarization using NLP

## Overview
This project performs **text summarization** using both **extractive and abstractive** approaches. It can scrape text from webpages, process it, and generate summaries while evaluating them using ROUGE scores.

## Tasks
- **Web Scraping:**
  - Extract text from webpages using `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Tokenization and cleaning using `nltk`.
- **Summarization Techniques:**
  - **Extractive Summarization:** Uses TextRank from `sumy`.
  - **Abstractive Summarization:** Utilizes transformer-based models (BART).
- **Evaluation:**
  - Uses ROUGE scores to measure the quality of generated summaries.
